                    <p>I am a current first-year student studying Computer Science at Swinburne University of Technology.
                    I eventually want to get into game development; however, I wish to start with some experience in designing desktop/mobile applications and websites to fill the needs of bringing others into the 21st century.</p></td>

        So far, I am enjoying the game development electives, and I currently just made an online tabletop game called Antigravity.
        If there's enough demand, I might link to it here, watch this space...
        <p>While this is by no means my first website I've <em>tried</em> to make, I want to try to make this one stand out!</p>
        <p>So, a bit about me...I was born in Australia, in the city of Melbourne.
        I love playing video games, particularly city builders, platformers, open-world games, and even RPGs. Oh, and rhythm games!
        <br>
        My favourite rhythm game in particular is DanceDanceRevolution, having known it since 2009. While it has been on and off during my primary and high school years, in 2018, I started playing the game more seriously, and have been for almost 3 and a half years!
        I've managed to pass 2 of the highest level charts in the game, which are level 19s. Believe me, they're <strong>hard</strong>! It's definitely not as easy as it looks when you play it on the pad, trust me on this one.</p>
        <p>Apart from that, other things I like to do involve cooking, the occasional bouldering session, and playing tabletop games.</p>
        <p>Hopefully I can aspire to gain some experience in the technology field, as well as learning how to drive (<em>as much as the thought scares me...</em>), as there is no doubt that I won't have the luxury of public transport all the time should I enevitably move somewhere else.</p>
